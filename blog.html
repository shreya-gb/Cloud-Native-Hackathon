            <p class="text"><b>Everyday Examples of APIs</b>
            <br> API helps developers quickly deliver information to consumers and is used every day in today’s world. From shopping online, browsing a social media app, or playing a game on your smartphone. Every time you visit a page online, you’re interacting with API. Here are some real-world examples of how you interact with API and may not even realize.
            Going to a bank.
            Think of yourself as a user and a bank teller as an API, while the bank is the system you interact with. When you want to take some money out of your account, you walk up to the teller(API) and say “I’d like $1,000 from this account”. The teller (API) then goes to the back, tells the bank manager (the system) “Mr/Ms.X would like $1,000”, the bank manager (the system) gives the teller (API) $1,000 who eventually gives it to you. As you can see the API, is a messenger between your needs and the system. 
            Searching for hotels.
            When you go onto a travel site, it may be linked to 10 other travel sites to find the best deal for you. When you input details like Atlanta, 2 nights, 1 Room, you send this request to those 10 different travel sites. The API takes your request for that specific location, date range, and room and pings the 10 sites, who send back the deals they have found. You look through the 10 deals and pick the best one. Again, the API is a messenger for your requests.
            Finding a Facebook profile.
            Stalking your ex? Hopefully not, but thanks to APIs, you can do it easily! If you type in “John Smith” on Facebook, the API informs Facebook’s servers that you’re looking for John Smith. Facebook then sends you a list of all the profiles that match that name (with factors like vicinity to you, or mutual friends). Now you can find John Smith!

            <p class="text"><b>API Evolution for REST/HTTP APIs</b>
            <br>API evolution is making a comeback these days with GraphQL and gRPC advocates shouting about it. Whatever API paradigm or implementation you subscribe to, evolution is available to you. REST advocates have been recommending API evolution for decades, but in the past I failed to understand how exactly to handle evolution.
            Luckily, as always, tooling and standards for HTTP have been improving, and these days API evolution is a lot easier to wrap your head around.
            API evolution is the concept of striving to maintain the "I" in API, the request/response body, query parameters, general functionality, etc., only breaking them when you absolutely, absolutely, have to. It's the idea that API developers bending over backwards to maintain a contract, no matter how annoying that might be, is often more financially and logistically viable than dumping the workload onto a wide array of clients.
            At some point change cannot be prevented, so at that time evolution suggests you provide sensible warnings to clients, letting them know if a feature they're using is going away, and not bothering them otherwise.
            Evolution involves thinking a little differently on how you approach change. Often there are simple things you can do to keep clients ticking along, and whilst clients will have to change at some point, the whole goal here is to allow them a decent amount of time to make that switch, with the minimal change possible during that change, and no lock-step deploys required.

            <p class="text"><b>Self-Service APIs</b>
            <br>The strategies listed above aren’t rocket science. In fact, they’re things that many API-first companies are already doing. However, it might not immediately be readily apparent to newcomers why these tactics are necessary. Hopefully, if you’ve read this far, that picture will be clearer now.
            Marketing an API-centric SaaS has a lot in common with marketing other SaaS products, or any other product for that matter, but there are nuances associated with it. Considering these nuances, and increasing your service’s usability, is the best way to maximize the chances your API has of being successful. Making your API more self-service is also a surefire way to decrease one-on-one customer support, thus reducing cost!
